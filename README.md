 cooperativism as a system of government
 
We have had the misfortune to experience in recent years the most terrifying results of the eternal cold war. An incessant dispute for the imposition of a capitalist culture in confrontation with completely paternalistic government regimes. On the one hand, the capitalist world seeks new markets for the constant enrichment of a minority class. And on the other hand, countries with an almost dictatorial regime, strengthen their defenses to the teeth, to defend a standard of living with principles of equality.

It is especially difficult for someone who has not lived or lived through this war to understand in depth that the cold war was never really over.

Just as it is difficult to understand that all the widespread terrorism we are experiencing today (in 2023 and in the years leading up to it) is the result of the vestiges of a neo-capitalist world.

As things are progressing, there seems to be no visible way out. But maybe there is.

For some time now, cooperatives have been highlighted in Brazil. For this reason, this idea came very naturally to me: why not think of a form of government based on the principles of cooperativism ? This could works. But how ? Is it possible to think of a society living under a cooperative government? Would it be possible to have a change of government in this sense ? What would that change look like ?

Through an initial bibliographic search, I could see that this is not an original idea.

Charles Gide was a cooperative theologian who lived between 1847 and 1932. According to Gide, "the development of cooperatives should gradually absorb all branches of economic activity, extending from production to consumer goods, to the point of establishing a â€œ cooperative republic", with its own characteristics and differentiated from socialism and capitalism" (https://www.dificio.com.br/gide-charles-1847-1932).

It seems to me that many other authors before and after Charles defended this doctrine.

This directory is not properly linked to my project yet. Also because this subject does not belong to my area of knowledge and scientific work.

However, as a personal interest that arose in the last year, I intend to carry out a bibliographic survey on the subject, making the material or source available in this directory. And, if possible, I intend to develop a model of government that serves as an alternative proposal, also addressing the possible forms of transition. I intend to answer such questions based on the consulted literature and walking in the world of ideas.

So for that purpose this directory was created. I hope that even if the idea does not manage to progress, due to lack of time and other difficulties, that this text and material available here will motivate the development of this research in at least one researcher in the area.
