 cooperativism as a system of government
 
We have had the misfortune to experience in recent years the most terrifying results of the eternal cold war. An incessant dispute for the imposition of a capitalist culture in confrontation with completely paternalistic government regimes. On the one hand, the capitalist world seeks new markets for the constant enrichment of a minority class. And on the other hand, countries with an almost dictatorial regime, strengthen their defenses to the teeth, to defend a standard of living with principles of equality.

It is especially difficult for someone who has not lived or lived through this war to understand in depth that the cold war was never really over.

Just as it is difficult to understand that all the widespread terrorism we are experiencing today (in 2023 and in the years leading up to it) is the result of the vestiges of a neo-capitalist world.

As things are progressing, there seems to be no visible way out. But maybe there is.
