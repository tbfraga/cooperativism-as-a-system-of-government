 cooperativism as a system of government
 
We have had the misfortune to experience in recent years the most terrifying results of the eternal cold war. An incessant dispute for the imposition of a capitalist culture in confrontation with completely paternalistic government regimes.

And on the other hand, countries with an almost dictatorial regime, strengthen their defenses to the teeth, to defend a standard of living with principles of equality.
